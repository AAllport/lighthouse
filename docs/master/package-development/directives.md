# Adding directives

You can add your custom directives to Lighthouse by listening for the [`RegisterDirectiveNamespaces`](../api-reference/events.md#registerdirectivenamespaces) event.

Check out [the test suite](https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse/tree/master/tests/Integration/Events/RegisterDirectiveNamespacesTest.php)
for an example of how this works.
