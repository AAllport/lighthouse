# Listening for events

Lighthouse offers a unified way of hooking into the complete execution lifecycle
through [Laravel's event system](https://laravel.com/docs/events).
You may use the Service Provider of your package to register listeners.

You can find a complete list of all dispatched events [in the events API reference](../api-reference/events.md).
