# Package Development: Getting Started

Lighthouse is able to be extended in a lot of places. Plugin developers
may utilize this to offer users extra functionality that is not available in the core.

## Guidelines

- Try not to change core behaviour. Warn your users if you do.
- Consider improving the extensibility of Lighthouse with a PR instead of doing workarounds.
- Add your plugin to the Resources page once it is done.
