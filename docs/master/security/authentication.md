# Authentication

## Get the current user

Lighthouse provides a really simple way to fetch the information of the currently authenticated user.
Just add a field that returns your `User` type and decorate it with the [@auth](../api-reference/directives.md#auth) directive.

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User @auth
}
```

Sending the following query will return the authenticated user's info
or `null` if the request is not authenticated.

```graphql
{
  me {
    name
    email
  }
}
```
